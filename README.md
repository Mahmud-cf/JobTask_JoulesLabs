- Applied drag and drop function to the text item.

## Tech Stack

To make this app the core technology is 'React JS', 'TypeScript', 'Tailwind CSS'. Besides these, I have used some libraries. 

**React Js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React-dnd-kit**, **React-dropzone**,  **Konva JS** 





## Challenges

- The first challenge I faced was to use TypeScript. I only work a little with TypeScript. For this project, I have learned TypeScript and implemented it in this project.
- The second challenge I faced was to show the uploading progress bar.  I have solved it using React-dropzone. 
- The third challenge I faced was to implement drag-and-drop functionality. First I used react-beautiful-dnd. But after 4 hours of bug fixing, I found a documentation page from their official GitHub repo. This problem is due to their library not being updated for a long time. After that, I used 'React-dnd-kit' and solved the drag-and-drop feature.
